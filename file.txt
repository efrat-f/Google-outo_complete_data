Certain objects available in Python wrap access to an underlying
memory array or *buffer*.  Such objects include the built-in "bytes"
and "bytearray", and some extension types like "array.array". Third-
party libraries may define their own types for special purposes, such
as image processing or numeric analysis.

While each of these types have their own semantics, they share the
common characteristic of being backed by a possibly large memory
buffer.  It is then desirable, in some situations, to access that
buffer directly and without intermediate copying.
